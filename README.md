### How to use

Choose two hands, and let the application tell you who's the winner

This application uses Texas Hold'em rules, and since its the first version, isn't very well optimized yet (I choose to avoid over-engineering and not surpase deadline)

### Technologies

- State Management with Provider package
- Unit tests with Test package

### Limitations

- Since this application was developed in 3 days, I didn't covered all draw cases
